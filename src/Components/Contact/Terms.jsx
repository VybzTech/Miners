These Terms are for the benefit of each Ville affiliate and each Ville group affiliate may enforce these Terms.
Certain features or components of the ${serviceName} may be subject to additional terms and conditions, including user guidelines or other rules, which will be posted on the applicable ${serviceName}. Those additional terms and conditions are part of these Terms.

              provision of the Terms is void, invalid, unenforceable, or
              illegal, such provision(s) will be ineffective only to the extent
              of such invalidity or unenforceability and the validity and

              Terms, that will not constitute or be construed as a waiver of
